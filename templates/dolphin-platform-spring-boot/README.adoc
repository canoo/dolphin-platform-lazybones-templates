# Dolphin Platform Spring Boot Sample

![Dolphin Platform Logo](http://www.guigarage.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/logo.png)

This automatically created project can be used as a basic skeleton for a Spring Boot based Dolphin Platform application.
The project contains 3 modules:

* The __common__ module that contains the model that is shared between client and server
* The __server__ module that contains the Spring Boot Application and a first Dolphin Platform controller
* The __client__ module a JavaFX application that creates a view that is bound to the Dolphin Platform controller in the server module

## How to use it

The project is created with a gradle build. You can directly import it in any IDE that supports Gradle (like Eclipse or IntelliJ).
If you want to start the application you need to start the __ServerApplication__ class in the server module and than the __ClientApplication__ class in the client module. The client can be started several times.

If you want to start the application from commandline without IDE support you can use the following commands:

Run the server from the server folder
```
cd server
gradle bootRun
```

A client instance can be started, too:
```
cd client
gradle run
```
